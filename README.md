# Face-recognition-python
This project involves the development of a face recognition system using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The system was built using the Python programming language, with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using Tkinter. The system was trained on the AT&T dataset, consisting of 400 images of 40 individuals, with 10 images per person. The dataset was split into training and testing data, with the images resized to 128x128 and converted to grayscale. The SVM was trained on the training data, achieving an accuracy of 100%, and was evaluated on the testing data, achieving an accuracy of 95%. The main packages used in the development of the system were cv2, numpy, sklearn-svm, and joblib. The final model was saved using the joblib package. In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of the SVM algorithm in face recognition tasks and provides a basis for further improvements in accuracy and scalability.
